            <h4>Adventures in Programming</h4>

            <!-- start slipsum code -->

            <p>Hi! Welcome to my blog!</p>

            <p>I'm fairly new to programming - this personal website is the first thing that I ever built on my own. What I want to accomplish with this blog is simple - I want it to be a resource for all of the other true beginners out there. I will keep as detailed of a log as possible of all of the resources that I use, the decisions that I make, and the projects that I am working on.</p>

            <p>One thing that I have noticed about the programming community is that it is very open to beginners - ask for help, and chances are someone will respond positively and give you their real opinion. The best way to learn, in my opinion, is from experience - be it your own, or of others. However, I have also noticed that the industry (like many others) has a lot of jargon that sometimes gets skipped over. These are the sorts of things that are all over the place, and I had to do a lot of digging to find out exactly what they meant.</p>

              <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

              <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
