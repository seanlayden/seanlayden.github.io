            <h4>Hello World!</h4>

            <p>
             My name is Sean Layden and I am, for lack of a better term, a "Developer-In-Training." After graduating from the University of Colorado with a degree in Economics, I worked a few jobs and explored a few fields. It was at this point, however, that I decided to abandon my trades and commit to my passion - making things!
            </p>

            <p>
            At the suggestion of a close friend, I dived into coding with an introduction from Codecademy. I started with the fairly simple HTML/CSS Web Development track, and I was hooked. Since then, I've been participating in a number of courses to improve my toolkit. The /r/learnjavascript subreddit's Learn JavaScript Properly course, as well as Code School's JavaScript track have helped me learn how to add some interactivity to my websites, while CS50x over at edX has helped me with basic programming concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the long run, I want to learn as much about JavaScript as possible. I really enjoy using the language and I find myself very inspired by all of the things that it can do.

            I do, unfortunately, find myself a bit overwhelmed at times, due to the vast amount of information that's available. From NodeJS, to MeteorJS, to EmberJS, to BackboneJS, to CoffeeScript.... you get the idea.

            But I really do hope to learn all of these things one day! If you have any suggestions, go ahead and shoot me an email. Thanks!
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, I am hoping to land a job as a junior developer. In the mean time, I'll be continuing to broaden my skillset, both with specific languages/frameworks, and with overall programming concepts. I will be updating a blog that is linked to from this website, as a detailed account of my journey into programming.
            </p>

                      I'm essentially learning Web Development in HTML5/CSS3, which I'm aware are relative newcomers in the world of development. That being said, I'm growing more and more comfortable with the functionality of both platforms, and I'm looking forward learning more about how to use them!

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
