            <h4>Hello World!</h4>

            <p>
             My name is Sean Layden and I am, for lack of a better term, a "Developer-In-Training." After graduating from the University of Colorado with a degree in Economics, I worked a few jobs and explored a few fields. It was at this point, however, that I decided to abandon my trades and commit to my passion - making things!
            </p>

            <p>
            At the suggestion of a close friend, I dived into coding with an introduction from Codecademy. I started with the fairly simple HTML/CSS Web Development track, and I was hooked. Since then, I've been participating in a number of courses to improve my toolkit. The /r/learnjavascript subreddit's Learn JavaScript Properly course, as well as Code School's JavaScript track have helped me learn how to add some interactivity to my websites, while CS50x over at edX has helped me with basic programming concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the long run, I want to learn as much about JavaScript as possible. I really enjoy using the language and I find myself very inspired by all of the things that it can do.

            I do, unfortunately, find myself a bit overwhelmed at times, due to the vast amount of information that's available. From NodeJS, to MeteorJS, to EmberJS, to BackboneJS, to CoffeeScript.... you get the idea.

            But I really do hope to learn all of these things one day! If you have any suggestions, go ahead and shoot me an email. Thanks!
            </p>

            <p>
            Now, I am hoping to land a job as a junior developer. In the mean time, I'll be continuing to broaden my skillset, both with specific languages/frameworks, and with overall programming concepts. I will be updating a blog that is linked to from this website, as a detailed account of my journey into programming.

          <h4>What I'm currently learning</h4>
          <p>When I decided to make the switch into Development, one of the biggest challenges I faced was finding a way to structure my learning process. At the beginning, I would start something, get distracted with an explanation, and end up three languages over. Then, I found <a href="#">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
          <p>Having a structured curriculum has been instrumental in learning more quickly - it helps me to stay on task and prevents me from getting ahead of myself. If you're like me and you're just starting to learn, I highly suggest you check it out.
